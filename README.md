* An assorted collection of Dockerfiles, mostly designed for home server/lab
  use. Build/run instructions are in each subdirectory. Bold items are ones that
  I currently use. Others could potentially be out of date. I prefer when
  possible to build my own Docker images rather than pull images build by
  someone else. The only exceptions are `official` images that are vetted by
  Docker and the Plex image.
